Description:
We are using methods we've learned throughout the semester including using gauss-seidel, jacobi method, and newton raphson to find the number of iterations. We also use the divided differenece method to print out the hermite interpolation matrix and lastly we use the modified eulers method to find the final value.

Technology:
- Github

Installation: 
Use init.py to import any packages. For this assignment, only numpy was required. To get this, you will type "import numpy as np". There is no need for the requirements.txt since we only need numpy, however I included it as well as a precaution. This would be necessary if you needed to install packages other than numpy.

Running the program In the command line you will hit the triangle button the run the program.
